- Add a new map
- - Cick and hold a map to drag and move it anywhere
- Click on a map to change size and to delete it
- View and copy JSON code and use it to generate a region from the console

This plugin calls TheoTown.execute("cr:{}") to generate a region (you can do so from the console stage), which causes lag (or even crashes on low-end devices) (unless the region is small enough for your hardware to handle), and for some every-lua-plugin-f***ing reason on some or all devices the region doesn't generate and instead displays a **'...///bit32' not found: ...///bit32Library was not found** error, so I have nothing to do about these issues, except for one, which the devs must fix now if they are reading this message.
