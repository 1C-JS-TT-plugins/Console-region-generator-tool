**Please, before installation:**
- Remove or move older versions out of the plugins folder
to prevent id conflict errors
- Starting from v4.0.2, rename the file extension to .zip
as the game is unable to load unencrypted .plugin files

**Usage:**
- Press "+" to add a new map;
- - Cick the map to change size or remove it;
- - Hold and drag the map go move it anywhere
- View and copy JSON code and paste into the command field to generate a region from the console; you can also import the JSON from the field into the tool to preview the region before generating it
